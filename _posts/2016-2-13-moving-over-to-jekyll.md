title: Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll 
---

I'm currently in the process of porting over my old [blog](http://joshuagoings.wordpress.com) to Jekyll and GitHub pages. I was getting tired of the bloat dealing with Wordpress, and wanted a cleaner, snappier website.

That and now I can blog in markdown! From the terminal! And version control and hosting with `git` and GitHub! I never though I would see the day. 

Welcome to the future, folks.

Many of the old posts are here (and they look so much better!), but I'm still working out some of the finer details for the more math-intensive posts, since GitHub-flavored-markdown does not play well with LaTeX. Hopefully I'll have something up soon!
