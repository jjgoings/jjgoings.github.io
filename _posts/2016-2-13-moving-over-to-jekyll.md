title: Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll 
---

I'm currently in the process of porting over my old WordPress blog to GitHub Pages, which supports [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). I was getting tired of the bloat dealing with Wordpress, and wanted a cleaner, snappier website.

That and now I can blog in markdown, which is a great advantage to using Jekyll! From the terminal! And version control and hosting with `git` and GitHub!

I'm a little late to the party, but glad I made it.
