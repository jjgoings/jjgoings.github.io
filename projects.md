Here are a couple of side projects I've been working on for fun.

### [Natural language processing (NLP) of Trump and COVID-19](https://github.com/jjgoings/trump-covid-briefings)

Like many Americans, I have been following the news closely during this pandemic. I got interested in [how Trump was talking about the coronavirus](https://github.com/jjgoings/trump-covid-briefings) and thought it would be fun to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to idenify what topics Trump talks about and how his senitiment is connected to world events. Spoiler alert: although he tends to have a positive attitude, most of it is because he is praising his administration!

### [Interactive New Haven crime map](https://github.com/jjgoings/new-haven-major-crimes)

New Haven isn't exactly [known for being the safest city](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/americas-10-most-dangerous-cities/7/) in America, and I wanted to learn more. But the data didn't exist in a nice form. So I made an interactive map of recent crime that I scraped from the New Haven Police Department. It was fun to learn how to scrape data from PDFs, clean it up, geo-tag the results, and deploy as an interactive webapp.

### [McMurchie-Davidson](https://github.com/jjgoings/McMurchie-Davidson)

It was a dream in graduate school to build an electronic structure program from scratch. [This was the result](https://github.com/jjgoings/McMurchie-Davidson), using the McMurchie-Davidson algorithm to compute the (very expensive) electronic integrals. It allows you to, among other things, simulate how molecules respond to light in real-time. I also dabbled in learning Cython to accelerate the algorithm in performance-critical routines, without sacrificing code readability.
