<p>I am Joshua Goings, a theoretical chemistry post-doc at the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>. Here you can find most of the things I've produced as I study and research. I hope you find something useful here -- feel free to contact me at <i> jjgoings [at] illinois [dot] edu!</i></p>
