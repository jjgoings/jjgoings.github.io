<p>I am Joshua Goings, a theoretical chemistry post-doc with the <a href="http://hammes-schiffer-group.org/">Hammes-Schiffer group</a> at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Here you can find various notes I've made as I study and research. I hope you find something useful here -- feel free to contact me at <b> jjgoings [at] illinois [dot] edu!</b></p>
