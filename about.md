<p>Hi! This is my (Joshua Goings') personal webpage.</p>

<p>I consider myself primarily a problem-solver, and have wide range of interests generally revolving around writing computer code to make sense of complexity. I'm an avid Python programmer (over a decade now!), and I also like cooking, hiking, and the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm a postdoc at Yale, doing research in the <a href="http://hammes-schiffer-group.org/">Hammes-Schiffer lab</a> working at the interface of computational chemistry and biology. Previously, I was an NSF Graduate Fellow at the <a href="http://uwligroup.org/">University of Washington</a> (theoretical and computational chemistry), and got my Bachelor's from Seattle Pacific University.</p> 

<p>I hope you find something useful here -- feel free to contact me at <b> jjgoings [at] gmail [dot] com!</b></p>
