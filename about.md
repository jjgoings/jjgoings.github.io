<p>I am Joshua Goings, a graduate student at the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup/">University of Washington</a>, studying theoretical chemistry. This web page is simply a place to for me to share my code and derivations that I find as I study and research. I hope you find something useful here -- feel free to <a href="mailto:jjgoings@uw.edu">contact</a> me if you find errors or have suggestions or anything!</p>
